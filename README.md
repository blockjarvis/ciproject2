This comprehensive site was designed for a memory game. The focus of the site is to provide a functional memory game with a clean and modern design.

This is the second of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute.

The main requirements were to make a responsive website that responds to the users actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the 
site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

## UX

The purpose is to design an attractive website to play a memory game, with a simple and intuitive layout that works on mobiles, tablets or desktops.

3. As a first time visitor, I want to find some guidence on how the game is developing.

### Returning Visitor Goals
1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to have fun playing the game.
